    //OKAY, shapes are complicated, but because we are only going to use Squares and Triangles, what we can do is the line method
    // Basically, we get the point. With the point, we make a line. The line goes all right. We check if that line intersects with one
    // of the shapes lines. If it intersects with only one, it is inside, otherwise it is outside. Capish?
