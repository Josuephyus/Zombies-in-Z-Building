# Uhhhh

Sorry. I don't like the old code. It was ugly, clunky, and unnessesary.
Theres a term for java programming. "Great for writing Instant Legacy Code" and I couldn't agree more

### 0.1.0

This is a little late but I'm going to summarize the basics.

- Main.java - Sets up the JFrame and "Starts()" Listener and Artist

- util/Menus.java - Handles the JPanels in the folder "menus/".
- util/Logic.java - ...the logic. All calculations should be done in here
- util/Artist.java - Draws onto the JPanel _2 (as of now) in "menus/".
- util/Listener.java - Holds the Key/Mouse listeners for the window. Also holds the keybinds and whether they are active or not.

- util/menus/_#.java - A JPanel that is applied to the window. This is for GUIs.

- util/math/MathF.java - The default Math package for java uses doubles as the return values. As of now, MathF just casts the double as a float and returns it. Might be changed for manual optimizations (if it becomes and issue).
- util/math/Vec2.java - Essentially java.awt.Point but with floats. {x} and {y} are public, but has some additional functions such as distance, directionTo, add, multiply, etc.

- maps/_Map.java - The default map, and will be made to be extendable for more maps, but as of now, basic and no collision checks

- entities/_Entity.java - the default entity. To be noted, it stores a subclass called Resource that acts as the HP and (later) the player Stamina. Use it for... resources and maybe ammunition.
- entities/Player.java - Player has some additional functions to entity for manual control rather than AI but pretty basic.
- entities/Zombie.java - A custom "entity" that automatically follows the player, winds up an attack, and hits the player (if in range).

### 0.1.1

Very basic stuff.

- entities/Player.java
  "face(x, y)" function prepares for attacks/animations by turning to the mouse, its called in Logic.updatePlayer()
  "attack()" attacks in the direction facing. Currently, it calculates a half circle and a radius. It then checks all entities in radius, then all entities in "front" of the player before dealing 1 damage to them
- Logic.java
  "updateEnemies()" now removes enemies with less than or equal to 0 hp.
  "updateEnemies()" also checks if there are no more enemies before increasing the round count and adding more enemies all at once
  "updatePlayer()" now calls "PLAYER.face(ML.x, ML.y)" to turn to the mouse. Some internal changes in Listener.java and Artist.java to correctly calculate, represent, and display the direction
  "updatePlayer()" calls attack when the keybind "Fire" is active.
